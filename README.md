# Facade Design pattern

## What is Facade Pattern
### Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Façade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## Advantage of Facade Pattern
### The Façade pattern provides an interface which shields clients from complex functionality in one or more subsystems. It is a simple pattern that may seem trivial but it is powerful and extremely useful. It is often present in systems that are built around a multi-layer architecture.
###The intent of the Façade is to provide a high-level interface (properties and methods) that makes a subsystem or toolkit easy to use for the client.
