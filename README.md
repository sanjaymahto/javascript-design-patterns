# javascript-design-patterns - Module Revealing Pattern

### What is the Factory Pattern?
### In its most basic incarnation the module pattern hides the module’s variables and functions making only what’s necessary accessible to the outside world.

### When Should We Use It?
### The module pattern is easy to use and creates encapsulation of our code. Modules are commonly used as singleton style objects where only one instance exists. The Module Pattern is great for services and testing/TDD
