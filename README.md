# javascript-design-patterns - Factory Pattern

### What is the Factory Pattern?
### Factory method is a creational design pattern, i.e., related to object creation. In Factory pattern, we create an object without exposing the creation logic to the client and the client uses the same common interface to create the new type of object.

### When Should We Use It?
### 1.) A class cannot anticipate the type of objects it needs to create beforehand.
### 2.) A class requires its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
### 3.) You want to localize the logic to instantiate a complex object.

### What is the use of the Factory Pattern?
### The factory pattern uses polymorphism, dependency injection and Inversion of control. The stated purpose of the Factory Patterns is: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
